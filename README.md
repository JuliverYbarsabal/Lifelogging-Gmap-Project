# Lifelogging-Gmap-Project 

Software used: Visual studio IDE

My project aim is to develop a system that is dependent on a person using lifelogging technology to input valuable personal information into the system

My system has a WinForms-based C#.NET program that contains a G map, which consist of:

Basic features:

- create several more events (at least 20) into the file

- create a Windows form GUI using Visual Studio and create a canvas area/map to   display the             events from your SOAP file

- create a LINQ to XML to load the data from the SOAP file into an appropriate collection of               objects. In addition know how to Use a C# Dictionary as the format for my collection and to develop     an appropriate class(es) for the events.

- Aim to Display the events (using suitable icons, text etc) on the canvas

- Aim to give the user the option to Add a new event or Retrieve information by clicking on the canvas.   Overall, If adding, my system should use a sub form to obtain the relevant information and insert into   the SOAP file. If retrieving, I should develop a method to indicate which of the current events are     being accessed and display the information.

-	Aim to allow users the ability to review and link related Events

-	Aim to allow users to add People into the system

-	implemented a calendar within my GUI program which acts as a normal calendar in which you can see the   current date and scroll though different dates and years
